# aa-py-csv

DEPRECATED. This repo never contained more than one function: `query_csv`. It was extracted from `aa-py-xl`. However, it was only used in the `aa-py-autory` and `autory` repos, and since the `autory` repo requires `aa-py-autory`, we might as well put this function directly in `aa-py-autory`. I started moving it there on 2024/02/09.
